        <div style="color: blue;">The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.  <br>
        It is the largest living rodent[2] and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). <br>
        Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. <br>
        The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals,
         but usually live in groups of 10â€“20 individuals. <br>
        The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.<br></div>
